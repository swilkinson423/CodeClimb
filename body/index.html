					Climbing a mountain can be a very scary thing to think about. Looking up at the summit from the bottom, it is easy to think that it will be imposible to make it to the top. But, what every climber will tell you, from the couple hiking along the trail, to the woman free-climbing up a rock face, is that no matter what else happens, it's certain you will not make it if you never take that first step.
					<br>
					<br>
					CodeClimb is dedicated to making that very first step as easy as possible for anyone thinking about learning to write code, and to help you along your journey, until one day, your talents even outshine my humble skills!!

						<p>
						Am I a world-class programmer? Am I a technical wizard? Did I teach myself programming when I was 7 years old? No, not at all. I am just a 30-something normal guy, learning to program in my free time. 
						<br><br>
						Do I want to share what I am learning so that everyone who wants to learn to program can avoid some of my more time-consuming mistakes? Yes, I do. 
						<br><br>
						So, please, don't take this as a difinitive explanation of everything there is to know about programming. Simple put, this site is intended to make some sense out of the enormous amount of information out there about programming. I spent so much time trying to figure out what I wanted to learn, and I found it very difficult to get real answers as a beginner programmer. 
						<br><br>
						I hope that this site will help you, I hope that it will make some of your early decisions easier, and I hope that by using this site you can quickly jump into the fun stuff without having to spend so much time on trial and error. 
						<br><br>
						Best of luck to you on your journey.
